If we make a para1 and then create another para2 then always para1 will be above and 
para2 will be below it

Block element:- In deafult the element are in block state that if there is space beside them
then also they will not allow other element to be in the same line

which is a big problem to over come this we came up with

inline element: if para1 and para2 are inline in nature then they will come in the same line
but only if there is enough space for para2 to fit in with para1 .if there is no space then para2 will go down.
and inline doesnot allow to increaase the width and heigth of an element so width and heigth will 
remain constant.so now how can we solve our problem?

inline block: 
- it allows us to increase the width and height but still it remains on the same line
- it comes under flow layout which means it follows the normal flow of text i.e. top
to bottom or left to right.
